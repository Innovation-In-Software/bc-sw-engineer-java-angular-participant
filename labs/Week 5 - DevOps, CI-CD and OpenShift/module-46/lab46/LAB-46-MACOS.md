# Lab 46: Kafka Resilience and Observability — Northstar CRM Event Paths — macOS

**OS:** macOS  
**Primary IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition  
**Optional IDE:** VS Code  
**Shell:** macOS Terminal (zsh)  
**Stack hint:** JDK 21 · Maven · Spring Kafka · Embedded Kafka ITs · IntelliJ  
**Full lab steps:** [LAB-46-GUIDE.md](LAB-46-GUIDE.md)  
**Pre-lab exercises:** [`../exercises/EXERCISES-INDEX.md`](../exercises/EXERCISES-INDEX.md)  
**Other OS:** [Windows guide](LAB-46-WINDOWS.md) · [IDE conventions](../../../Week%201%20-%20Java%20and%20JVM%20Foundations/_IDE-CONVENTIONS.md)


## Prerequisites (macOS)

- [Lab 0 (macOS)](../../../Week%201%20-%20Java%20and%20JVM%20Foundations/module-00/lab0/LAB-0-MACOS.md) complete (JDK 21, Maven when needed, Git)
- Lab 31 produce/consume notes available
- IntelliJ with **Project SDK 21** (open/run steps: [IDE conventions](../../../Week%201%20-%20Java%20and%20JVM%20Foundations/_IDE-CONVENTIONS.md))

## Paths (macOS)

| Item | macOS |
| ---- | ------- |
| Workspace (open in IDE) | `~/java-bootcamp` |
| This lab project | `~/java-bootcamp/examples/lab46-crm` |
| Shell | macOS Terminal inside IntelliJ |
| Path style | Forward slashes |

```bash
cd ~/java-bootcamp
# Lab 0 layout: code under examples/; commit to your GitHub repo
cd examples/lab46-crm
```

### Commands this lab typically uses

```bash
cd ~/java-bootcamp/examples/lab46-crm
mvn -B test
```

Embedded Kafka ITs — no Docker broker and no OpenShift required for the timed path. Do **not** use `kubectl`/k3s.

## Do the lab

Complete every step in **[LAB-46-GUIDE.md](LAB-46-GUIDE.md)**. GUIDE paths already use `~/java-bootcamp`.  
Open/run IntelliJ steps are the same every lab — see [IDE conventions](../../../Week%201%20-%20Java%20and%20JVM%20Foundations/_IDE-CONVENTIONS.md).
